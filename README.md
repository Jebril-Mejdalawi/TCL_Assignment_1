# TCL_Assignment_1
I'm supposed to solve a simple sorting problem with TCL programming language (I language I never heard of before) ðŸ”¥ 
Steps :
1- I learned the basics of the language from Tutorialspoint (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tcl-tk/index.htm)
2- I analysed the problem statement :
  "Sort Function
Suppose that you have a list of 10 numbers, this list contains the numbers from 0 - 9 which are randomly sorted.
The list reserves 10 bytes of memory, each number reserves one byte.
Write a TCL procedure, which takes this list as an argument, and returns the list sorted in ascending order with a minimum number of iterations.
NOTE: Don't use TCL built-in sort function."

3- I wrote initial code.
